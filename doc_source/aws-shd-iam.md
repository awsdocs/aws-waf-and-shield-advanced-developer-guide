# AWS Identity and Access Management<a name="aws-shd-iam"></a>

Shield Advanced integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\), a service that lets your organization do the following:
+ Create users and groups under your organization's AWS account
+ Share your AWS account resources with users in the account
+ Assign unique security credentials to each user
+ Control user access to services and resources

For example, you can use IAM with Shield Advanced to control which users in your AWS account can create a new web ACL\.
