# AWS Identity and Access Management<a name="classic-aws-waf-iam"></a>

**Note**  
This is **AWS WAF Classic** documentation\. You should only use this version if you created AWS WAF resources, like rules and web ACLs, in AWS WAF prior to November 2019, and you have not migrated them over to the latest version yet\. To migrate your resources, see [Migrating your AWS WAF Classic resources to AWS WAF ](waf-migrating-from-classic.md)\.  
**For the latest version of AWS WAF**, see [AWS WAF](waf-chapter.md)\. 

AWS WAF Classic integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\), a service that lets your organization do the following:
+ Create users and groups under your organization's AWS account
+ Share your AWS account resources with users in the account
+ Assign unique security credentials to each user
+ Control user access to services and resources

For example, you can use IAM with AWS WAF Classic to control which users in your AWS account can create a new web ACL\.
