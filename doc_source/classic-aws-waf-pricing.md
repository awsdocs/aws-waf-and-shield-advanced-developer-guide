**Note**  
This is **AWS WAF Classic** documentation\. You should only use this version if you created AWS WAF resources, like rules and web ACLs, in AWS WAF prior to November 2019, and you have not migrated them over to the latest version yet\. To migrate your resources, see [Migrating your AWS WAF Classic resources to AWS WAF](waf-migrating-from-classic.md)\.  
**For the latest version of AWS WAF**, see [AWS WAF](waf-chapter.md)\.

With AWS WAF Classic, you pay only for the web ACLs and rules that you create, and for the number of HTTP requests that AWS WAF Classic inspects\. For more information, see [AWS WAF Classic Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/waf/pricing/)\.
