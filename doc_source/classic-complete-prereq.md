**Note**  
This is **AWS WAF Classic** documentation\. You should only use this version if you created AWS WAF resources, like rules and web ACLs, in AWS WAF prior to November 2019, and you have not migrated them over to the latest version yet\. To migrate your resources, see [Migrating your AWS WAF Classic resources to AWS WAF](waf-migrating-from-classic.md)\.  
**For the latest version of AWS WAF**, see [AWS WAF](waf-chapter.md)\. 

There are several mandatory steps to prepare your account for AWS Firewall Manager\. Those steps are described in [AWS Firewall Manager prerequisites](fms-prereq.md)\. Complete all the prerequisites before proceeding to [Step 2: Create rules](classic-get-started-fms-create-rules.md)\.
