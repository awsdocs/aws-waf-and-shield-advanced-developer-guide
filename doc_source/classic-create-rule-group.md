# Creating an AWS WAF Classic rule group<a name="classic-create-rule-group"></a>

**Note**  
This is **AWS WAF Classic** documentation\. You should only use this version if you created AWS WAF resources, like rules and web ACLs, in AWS WAF prior to November 2019, and you have not migrated them over to the latest version yet\. To migrate your resources, see [Migrating your AWS WAF Classic resources to AWS WAF](waf-migrating-from-classic.md)\.  
**For the latest version of AWS WAF**, see [AWS WAF](waf-chapter.md)\. 

When you create an AWS WAF Classic rule group to use with AWS Firewall Manager, you specify which rules to add to the group\.<a name="classic-create-rule-group-procedure"></a>

**To create a rule group \(console\)**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using the AWS Firewall Manager administrator account that you set up in the prerequisites, and then open the Firewall Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/fms](https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/fms)\. 
**Note**  
For information about setting up a Firewall Manager administrator account, see [Step 2: Set the AWS Firewall Manager administrator account](enable-integration.md)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Switch to AWS WAF Classic**\.

1. In the AWS WAF Classic navigation pane, choose **Rule groups**\.

1. Choose **Create rule group**\.
**Note**  
You can't add rate\-based rules to a rule group\.

1. If you have already created the rules that you want to add to the rule group, choose **Use existing rules for this rule group **\. If you want to create new rules to add to the rule group, choose **Create rules and conditions for this rule group**\. 

1. Choose **Next**\.

1. If you chose to create rules, follow the steps to create them at [Creating a rule and adding conditions](classic-web-acl-rules-creating.md)\. 
**Note**  
Use the AWS WAF Classic console to create your rules\. 

   When you've created all the rules you need, go to the next step\.

1. Type a rule group name\.

1. To add a rule to the rule group, select a rule then choose **Add rule**\. Choose whether to allow, block, or count requests that match the rule's conditions\. For more information on the choices, see [How AWS WAF Classic works](classic-how-aws-waf-works.md)\. 

1. When you are finished adding rules, choose **Create**\.

You can test your rule group by adding it to an AWS WAF WebACL and setting the WebACL action to **Override to Count**\. This action overrides any action that you choose for the rules contained in the group, and only counts matching requests\. For more information, see [Creating a Web ACL](classic-web-acl-creating.md)\.
