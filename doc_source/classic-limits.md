# AWS WAF Classic quotas<a name="classic-limits"></a>

**Note**  
This is **AWS WAF Classic** documentation\. You should only use this version if you created AWS WAF resources, like rules and web ACLs, in AWS WAF prior to November 2019, and you have not migrated them over to the latest version yet\. To migrate your resources, see [Migrating your AWS WAF Classic resources to AWS WAF](waf-migrating-from-classic.md)\.  
**For the latest version of AWS WAF**, see [AWS WAF](waf-chapter.md)\. 

AWS WAF Classic is subject to the following quotas \(formerly referred to as limits\)\. 

AWS WAF Classic has default quotas on the number of entities per account per Region\. You can [request an increase](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-waf) to these\.


| Resource | Default quota per account per Region | 
| --- | --- | 
| Web ACLs  | 50 | 
| Rules  | 100 | 
| Rate\-based\-rules  | 5 | 
| Conditions per account per Region | For all conditions except for regex match and geo match, 100 of each condition type\. For example, 100 size constraint conditions and 100 IP match conditions\. For regex and geo match conditions, see the following table\.  | 
| Requests per Second | 25,000 per web ACL\* | 

\*This quota applies only to AWS WAF Classic on an Application Load Balancer\. Requests per Second \(RPS\) quotas for AWS WAF Classic on CloudFront are the same as the RPS quotas support by CloudFront that is described in the [CloudFront Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html)\.
