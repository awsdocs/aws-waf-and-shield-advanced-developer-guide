# Adding and deleting rules from an AWS WAF Classic rule group<a name="classic-rule-group-editing"></a>

**Note**  
This is **AWS WAF Classic** documentation\. You should only use this version if you created AWS WAF resources, like rules and web ACLs, in AWS WAF prior to November 2019, and you have not migrated them over to the latest version yet\. To migrate your resources, see [Migrating your AWS WAF Classic resources to AWS WAF](waf-migrating-from-classic.md)\.  
**For the latest version of AWS WAF**, see [AWS WAF](waf-chapter.md)\. 

You can add or delete rules in an AWS WAF Classic rule group\.

Deleting a rule from the rule group does not delete the rule itself\. It only removes the rule from the rule group\.<a name="classic-rule-group-editing-procedure"></a>
