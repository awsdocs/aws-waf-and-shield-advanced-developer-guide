# AWS WAF Classic API permissions: Actions, resources, and conditions reference<a name="classic-waf-api-permissions-ref"></a>

**Note**  
This is **AWS WAF Classic** documentation\. You should only use this version if you created AWS WAF resources, like rules and web ACLs, in AWS WAF prior to November 2019, and you have not migrated them over to the latest version yet\. To migrate your resources, see [Migrating your AWS WAF Classic resources to AWS WAF](waf-migrating-from-classic.md)\.  
**For the latest version of AWS WAF**, see [AWS WAF](waf-chapter.md)\. 

When you set up [Access control](classic-waf-auth-and-access-control.md#classic-access-control) and writing permissions policies that you can attach to an IAM identity \(identity\-based policies\), you can use the following table as a reference\. The table lists each AWS WAF Classic API operation, the corresponding actions for which you can grant permissions to perform the action, and the AWS resource for which you can grant the permissions\. You specify the actions in the policy's `Action` field, and you specify the resource value in the policy's `Resource` field\. 

You can use AWS condition keys in your AWS WAF Classic policies to express conditions\. For a complete list of AWS keys, see [Available Keys for Conditions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html#AvailableKeys) in the *IAM User Guide*\. 

**Note**  
To specify an action, use the `waf:` prefix followed by the API operation name \(for example, `waf:CreateIPSet`\)\.
