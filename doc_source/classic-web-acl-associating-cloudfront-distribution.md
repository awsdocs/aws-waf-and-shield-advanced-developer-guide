**Note**  
This is **AWS WAF Classic** documentation\. You should only use this version if you created AWS WAF resources, like rules and web ACLs, in AWS WAF prior to November 2019, and you have not migrated them over to the latest version yet\. To migrate your resources, see [Migrating your AWS WAF Classic resources to AWS WAF](waf-migrating-from-classic.md)\.  
**For the latest version of AWS WAF**, see [AWS WAF](waf-chapter.md)\. 

To associate or disassociate a web ACL, perform the applicable procedure\. Note that you also can associate a web ACL with a CloudFront distribution when you create or update the distribution\. For more information, see [Using AWS WAF Classic to Control Access to Your Content](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-awswaf.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*\.

The following restrictions apply when associating a web ACL:
+ Each API Gateway API, Application Load Balancer and CloudFront distribution can be associated with only one web ACL\.
+ Web ACLs associated with a CloudFront distribution cannot be associated with an Application Load Balancer or API Gateway API\. The web ACL can, however, be associated with other CloudFront distributions\.
