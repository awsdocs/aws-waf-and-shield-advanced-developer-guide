Conditions specify when you want to allow or block requests\.
+ To allow or block requests based on whether the requests appear to contain malicious scripts, create cross\-site scripting match conditions\. For more information, see [Working with cross\-site scripting match conditions](classic-web-acl-xss-conditions.md)\.
+ To allow or block requests based on the IP addresses that they originate from, create IP match conditions\. For more information, see [Working with IP match conditions](classic-web-acl-ip-conditions.md)\.
+ To allow or block requests based on the country that they originate from, create geo match conditions\. For more information, see [Working with geographic match conditions](classic-web-acl-geo-conditions.md)\.
+ To allow or block requests based on whether the requests exceed a specified length, create size constraint conditions\. For more information, see [Working with size constraint conditions](classic-web-acl-size-conditions.md)\.
+ To allow or block requests based on whether the requests appear to contain malicious SQL code, create SQL injection match conditions\. For more information, see [Working with SQL injection match conditions](classic-web-acl-sql-conditions.md)\.
+ To allow or block requests based on strings that appear in the requests, create string match conditions\. For more information, see [Working with string match conditions](classic-web-acl-string-conditions.md)\.
