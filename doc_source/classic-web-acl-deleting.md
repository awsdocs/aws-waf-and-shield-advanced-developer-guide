This is **AWS WAF Classic** documentation\.

To migrate your resources, see [Migrating your AWS WAF Classic resources to AWS WAF](waf-migrating-from-classic.md)\.  
**For the latest version of AWS WAF**, see [AWS WAF](waf-chapter.md)\. 

To delete a web ACL, you must remove the rules that are included in the web ACL and disassociate all CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers from the web ACL\. Perform the following procedure\.<a name="classic-web-acl-deleting-procedure"></a>
