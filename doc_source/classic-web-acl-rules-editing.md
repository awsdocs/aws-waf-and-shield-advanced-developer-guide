# Adding and removing conditions in a rule<a name="classic-web-acl-rules-editing"></a>

**Note**  
This is **AWS WAF Classic** documentation\. You should only use this version if you created AWS WAF resources, like rules and web ACLs, in AWS WAF prior to November 2019, and you have not migrated them over to the latest version yet\. To migrate your resources, see [Migrating your AWS WAF Classic resources to AWS WAF](waf-migrating-from-classic.md)\.  
**For the latest version of AWS WAF**, see [AWS WAF](waf-chapter.md)\. 

You can change a rule by adding or removing conditions\. <a name="classic-web-acl-rules-editing-procedure"></a>

**To add or remove conditions in a rule**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS WAF console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/wafv2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/)\. 

   If you see **Switch to AWS WAF Classic** in the navigation pane, select it\.

1. Choose the name of the rule in which you want to add or remove conditions\.

1. Choose **Add rule**\.

1. To add a condition, choose **Add condition** and specify the following values:  
**When a request does/does not**  
If you want AWS WAF Classic to allow or block requests based on the filters in a condition, for example, web requests that originate from the range of IP addresses 192\.0\.2\.0/24, choose **does**\.  
If you want AWS WAF Classic to allow or block requests based on the inverse of the filters in a condition, choose **does not**\. For example, if an IP match condition includes the IP address range 192\.0\.2\.0/24 and you want AWS WAF Classic to allow or block requests that *do not* come from those IP addresses, choose **does not**\.  
**match/originate from**
