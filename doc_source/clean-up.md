# Step 3: Clean Up<a name="clean-up"></a>

To avoid extraneous charges, delete any unnecessary policies and resources\. 

**To delete a policy \(console\)**

1. On the **AWS Firewall Manager policies** page, choose the radio button next to the policy name, and then choose **Delete**\. 

1. In the **Delete** confirmation box, select **Delete all policy resources**, and then choose **Delete** again\.

   AWS WAF removes the policy and any associated resources, like web ACLs, that it created in your account\. The changes might take a few minutes to propagate to all accounts\.
