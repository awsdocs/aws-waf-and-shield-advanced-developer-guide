# Tracking resource protection changes in AWS Config<a name="ddos-add-config"></a>

You can record changes to the AWS Shield Advanced protection of your resources using AWS Config\. You can then use this information to maintain a configuration change history for audit and troubleshooting purposes\.

To record protection changes, enable AWS Config for each resource that you want to track\. For more information, see [Getting Started with AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html) in the *AWS Config Developer Guide*\.

You must enable AWS Config for each AWS Region that contains the tracked resources\. You can enable AWS Config manually, or you can use the AWS CloudFormation template "Enable AWS Config" at [AWS CloudFormation StackSets Sample Templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-sampletemplates.html) in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide*\.

If you enable AWS Config, you're charged as detailed on the [AWS Config Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/config/pricing/) page\.

**Note**  
If you already have AWS Config enabled for the necessary Regions and resources, you don't need to do anything\. AWS Config logs regarding protection changes to your resources start populating automatically\.

After enabling AWS Config, use the US East \(N\. Virginia\) Region in the AWS Config console to view the configuration change history for AWS Shield Advanced global resources\. 

View the change history for AWS Shield Advanced regional resources via the AWS Config console in the US East \(N\. Virginia\), US East \(Ohio\), US West \(Oregon\), US West \(N\. California\), Europe \(Ireland\), Europe \(Frankfurt\), Asia Pacific \(Tokyo\), and Asia Pacific \(Sydney\) Regions\.
