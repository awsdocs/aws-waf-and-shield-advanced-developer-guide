# Best practices for using automatic mitigation<a name="ddos-automatic-app-layer-response-bp"></a>

Adhere to the guidance provided here when you use automatic mitigation\.
+ Manage all of your automatic mitigation protections either through Shield Advanced or, if you're using AWS Firewall Manager to manage your Shield Advanced automatic mitigation settings, through Firewall Manager\. Don't mix your use of Shield Advanced and Firewall Manager to manage these protections\.
+ Manage similar resources using the same web ACLs and protection settings, and manage dissimilar resources using different web ACLs\. When Shield Advanced mitigates a DDoS attack on a protected resource, it defines rules for the web ACL that's associated with the resource and then tests the rules against traffic of all resources that are associated with the web ACL\. Shield Advanced will only apply the rules if they don't negatively impact any of the associated resources\. For more information, see [How Shield Advanced manages automatic mitigation](ddos-automatic-app-layer-response-behavior.md)\.
+ Don't delete any rule group from your web ACLs whose name starts with `ShieldMitigationRuleGroup`\. If you do, you disable the protections provided by Shield Advanced automatic mitigation for every resource that's associated with the web ACL\. Additionally, it can take Shield Advanced some time to receive notice of the change and to update its settings\. During this time, the Shield Advanced console pages will provide incorrect information\. For more information, see [The Shield Advanced rule group reference statement](ddos-automatic-app-layer-response-rg.md)\.
+ For Application Load Balancers that have all their internet traffic proxied through a Amazon CloudFront distribution, only enable automatic mitigation on the CloudFront distribution\. The CloudFront distribution will always have the greatest number of original traffic attributes, which Shield Advanced leverages to mitigate attacks\.
