# AWS Shield Advanced mitigation logic for web applications<a name="ddos-event-mitigation-logic-adv-web-app"></a>

AWS Shield Advanced uses AWS WAF to mitigate web application layer attacks\. AWS WAF is included with Shield Advanced at no additional cost\. When you protect an Amazon CloudFront distribution or Application Load Balancer with Shield Advanced, you can use Shield Advanced to associate an AWS WAF web ACL with your protected resource, if you don't already have one associated\. If you haven't already configured a web ACL, you can use the Shield Advanced console wizard to create one and add a rate\-based rule to it\. A rate\-based rule limits the number of requests per five minute time window for each IP address, providing basic protections against web application layer request floods\. You can configure the rate, starting as low as 100\. For more information, see [Shield Advanced application layer AWS WAF web ACLs and rate\-based rules](ddos-app-layer-web-ACL-and-rbr.md)\.

For enhanced protection, enable Shield Advanced automatic application layer mitigation\. With this option, when Shield Advanced detects an attack on a protected resource, it attempts to identify an attack signature that isolates the attack traffic from the normal traffic to your application\. Shield Advanced evaluates the identified attack signature against the historical traffic patterns for the resource that's under attack, as well as for any other resource that's associated with the same web ACL\. 

If Shield Advanced determines that the attack signature isolates only the traffic that's involved in the DDoS attack, it implements the signature in AWS WAF rules inside the associated web ACL\. You can instruct Shield Advanced to place mitigations that only count the traffic that they match against, or that block it, and you can change the setting at any time\. When Shield Advanced determines that its mitigating rules are no longer needed, it removes them from the web ACL\.
