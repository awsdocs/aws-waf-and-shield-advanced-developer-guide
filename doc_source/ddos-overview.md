A distributed denial of service \(DDoS\) attack is an attack in which multiple compromised systems attempt to flood a target, such as a network or web application, with traffic\. A DDoS attack can prevent legitimate users from accessing a service and can cause the system to crash due to the overwhelming traffic volume\.

AWS provides two levels of protection against DDoS attacks: AWS Shield Standard and AWS Shield Advanced\.
