# AWS Shield global and account activity<a name="ddos-standard-event-visibility"></a>

You can access an aggregated view of global threat activity and a per\-account event summary in the AWS Shield console **Getting Started** and **Global threat dashboard** pages\. 

The following screenshot shows an example **Getting Started** page\. 

![\[The AWS Shield console shows the Getting started page, containing the global threat and account event summary panes.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/)

**To access the AWS Shield console**
+ Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS WAF & Shield console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/wafv2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/)\. 

You don't need a subscription to Shield Advanced to access global activity and account event summary information\. 

**Global activity**  
 This information is available through the AWS Shield console **Global threat dashboard** and **Getting Started** pages\. The following screenshot shows an example of the global activity pane\.

Global activity describes DDoS events observed across all AWS customers\. Once per hour, AWS updates the information for the prior two weeks\. In the console pane, you can see the results, partitioned by AWS Region and displayed on a world heat map\. Next to the map, Shield displays summary information such as the largest packet attack, largest bit rate, most common vector, total number of attacks, and threat level\. The threat level is an assessment of the current global activity compared to what AWS typically observes\. The default threat level value is **Normal**\. AWS automatically updates the value to **High** for elevated DDoS activity\. 

The **Global threat dashboard** also provides time\-series metrics and gives you the ability to change between time durations\. To view the history of significant DDoS attacks, you can customize the dashboard for views from the last day to the last two weeks\. Time\-series metrics provide a view of the largest bit rate, packet rate, or request rate for all events detected by AWS Shield for applications running on AWS during the time window that you select\. 

**Account activity**  
This information is available in the AWS Shield console **Getting Started** page\. 

The following screenshot shows an example account activity pane\. 

![\[A AWS Shield console pane titled Account activity detected by Shield lists a summary of events for the past year, with information like the total number of events and the largest packet rate and request rate.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/)

Account activity describes DDoS events that Shield detected for your resources that are eligible for protection by Shield Advanced\. Each day, Shield creates summary metrics for the year ending at 00:00 UTC the prior day, and then displays total events, largest bit rate, largest packet rate, and largest request rate\. 
+ The total events metric reflects every time that Shield observed suspicious attributes in traffic that was destined to your application\. Suspicious attributes can include traffic that is at a higher than normal volume, traffic that does not match your applicationâ€™s historical profile, or traffic that does not match heuristics that are defined by Shield for valid application traffic\. 
+ Largest bit rate and largest packet rate statistics are available for every resource\. 
+ The largest request rate statistic is available only for Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers that have an associated AWS WAF web ACL\.

**Note**  
You can also access the account level event summary through the AWS Shield API operation [DescribeAttackStatistics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/DDOSAPIReference/API_DescribeAttack.html)\.
