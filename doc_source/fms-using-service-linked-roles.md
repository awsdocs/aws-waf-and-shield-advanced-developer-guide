# Using service\-linked roles for Firewall Manager<a name="fms-using-service-linked-roles"></a>

AWS Firewall Manager uses AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)[ service\-linked roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role)\. A service\-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to Firewall Manager\. Service\-linked roles are predefined by Firewall Manager and include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf\. 

A service\-linked role makes setting up Firewall Manager easier because you don’t have to manually add the necessary permissions\. Firewall Manager defines the permissions of its service\-linked roles, and unless defined otherwise, only Firewall Manager can assume its roles\. The defined permissions include the trust policy and the permissions policy\. That permissions policy can't be attached to any other IAM entity\.

You can delete a service\-linked role only after first deleting the role's related resources\. This protects your Firewall Manager resources because you can't inadvertently remove permission to access the resources\.

For information about other services that support service\-linked roles, see [AWS Services That Work with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html) and look for the services that have **Yes **in the **Service\-Linked Role** column\. Choose a **Yes** with a link to view the service\-linked role documentation for that service\.

## Service\-linked role permissions for Firewall Manager<a name="fms-slr-permissions"></a>

Firewall Manager uses the service\-linked role FMSServiceRolePolicy\.

AWS Firewall Manager uses this service\-linked role to write logs to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose\. This role is used only if you enable logging in AWS Firewall Manager\. For more information, see [Logging web ACL traffic information](logging.md)\.

The FMSServiceRolePolicy service\-linked role trusts the service to assume the role `fms.amazonaws.com`\. 

The permissions policies of the role allows Firewall Manager to complete the following actions on the specified resources:
+ Action: `firehose:PutRecord` and `firehose:PutRecordBatch` on Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose data stream resources with a name that starts with "aws\-fms\-logs\-\." For example, `aws-fms-logs-us-east-2-analytics`\.

You must configure permissions to allow an IAM entity \(such as a user, group, or role\) to create, edit, or delete a service\-linked role\. For more information, see [Service\-Linked Role Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#service-linked-role-permissions) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

## Creating a service\-linked role for Firewall Manager<a name="fms-create-slr"></a>

You don't need to manually create a service\-linked role\. When you enable Firewall Manager logging on the AWS Management Console, or you make a `PutLoggingConfiguration` request in the Firewall Manager CLI or the Firewall Manager API, Firewall Manager creates the service\-linked role for you\. 

You must have the `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole` permission to enable logging\.

If you delete this service\-linked role, and then need to create it again, you can use the same process to recreate the role in your account\. When you enable Firewall Manager logging, Firewall Manager creates the service\-linked role for you again\. 

## Editing a service\-linked role for Firewall Manager<a name="fms-edit-slr"></a>

Firewall Manager doesn't allow you to edit the FMSServiceRolePolicy service\-linked role\. After you create a service\-linked role, you can't change the name of the role because various entities might reference the role\. However, you can edit the description of the role using IAM\. For more information, see [Editing a Service\-Linked Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#edit-service-linked-role) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

## Deleting a service\-linked role for Firewall Manager<a name="fms-delete-slr"></a>

If you no longer need to use a feature or service that requires a service\-linked role, we recommend that you delete that role\. That way you don’t have an unused entity that is not actively monitored or maintained\. However, you must clean up the resources for your service\-linked role before you can manually delete it\.

**Note**  
If the Firewall Manager service is using the role when you try to delete the resources, then the deletion might fail\. If that happens, wait for a few minutes and try the operation again\.

**To delete the service\-linked role using IAM**

Use the IAM console, the IAM CLI, or the IAM API to delete the FMSServiceRolePolicy service\-linked role\. For more information, see [Deleting a Service\-Linked Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#delete-service-linked-role) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
