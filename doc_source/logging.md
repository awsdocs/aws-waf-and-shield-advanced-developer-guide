# Logging web ACL traffic<a name="logging"></a>

You can enable logging to get detailed information about traffic that is analyzed by your web ACL\. Logged information includes the time that AWS WAF received a web request from your AWS resource, detailed information about the request, and details about the rules that the request matched\. You can send your logs to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group, an Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) bucket, or an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose\.
