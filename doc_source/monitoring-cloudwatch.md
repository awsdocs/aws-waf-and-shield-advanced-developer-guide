# Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch<a name="monitoring-cloudwatch"></a>

You can monitor web requests and web ACLs and rules using Amazon CloudWatch, which collects and processes raw data from AWS WAF and AWS Shield Advanced into readable, near real\-time metrics\. You can use statistics in Amazon CloudWatch to gain a perspective on how your web application or service is performing\.  For more information, see [What is CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

**Note**  
CloudWatch metrics and alarms are not enabled for Firewall Manager\.

## Creating Amazon CloudWatch alarms<a name="creating_alarms"></a>

You can create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that sends an Amazon SNS message when the alarm changes state\. An alarm watches a single metric over a time period that you specify, and performs one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a specified threshold over a number of time periods\. The action is a notification sent to an Amazon SNS topic or Auto Scaling policy\. Alarms invoke actions for sustained state changes only\. CloudWatch alarms do not invoke actions simply because they are in a particular state; the state must have changed and been maintained for a specified number of periods\.

## AWS WAF and AWS Shield Advanced metrics and dimensions<a name="metrics_dimensions"></a>

Metrics are grouped first by the service namespace, and then by the various dimension combinations within each namespace\. 
+ The AWS WAF namespace is `AWS/WAFV2`
+ The Shield Advanced namespace is `AWS/DDoSProtection`

**Note**  
AWS WAF reports metrics once a minute\.  
Shield Advanced reports metrics once a minute during an event and less frequently other times\.

Use the following procedures to view the metrics for AWS WAF and AWS Shield Advanced\.

**To view metrics using the CloudWatch console**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. If necessary, change the Region to the one where your AWS resources are located\. For CloudFront, choose the US East \(N\. Virginia\) Region\.

1. In the navigation pane, under **Metrics**, choose **All metrics** and then search under the **Browse** tab for the service\. 

**To view metrics using the AWS CLI**
+ For AWS/WAFV2, at a command prompt use the following command:

  ```
  1. aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace "AWS/WAFV2"
  ```

  For Shield Advanced, at a command prompt use the following command:

  ```
  1. aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace "AWS/DDoSProtection"
  ```

## AWS WAF metrics and dimensions<a name="waf-metrics"></a>

## AWS Shield Advanced metrics and alarms<a name="set-ddos-alarms"></a>

This section discusses the metrics and alarms available with AWS Shield Advanced\.

### AWS Shield Advanced metrics<a name="shield-metrics"></a>

Shield Advanced reports metrics to Amazon CloudWatch on an AWS resource more frequently during DDoS events than while no events are underway\. Shield Advanced reports metrics once a minute during an event, and then once right after the event ends\. While no events are underway, Shield Advanced reports metrics once a day, at a time assigned to the resource\. This periodic report keeps the metrics active and available for use in custom CloudWatch alarms\. 

Shield Advanced reports metrics in the US East \(N\. Virginia\) Region, `us-east-1` for the following:
+ The global services Amazon CloudFront and Amazon RouteÂ 53\.
+ Protection groups\. For information about protection groups, see [AWS Shield Advanced protection groups](ddos-protection-groups.md)\.

Shield Advanced provides the following detection metrics and dimensions in the `AWS/DDoSProtection` namespace\. 


**Detection metrics**

| DDoSAttackBitsPerSecond | The number of bits observed during a DDoS event for a particular Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\)\. This metric is available only for network and transport layer \(layer 3 and layer 4\) DDoS events\. This metric has a non\-zero value during an event\.Units: Bits  | 
| DDoSAttackPacketsPerSecond | The number of packets observed during a DDoS event for a particular Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\)\. This metric is available only for network and transport layer \(layer 3 and layer 4\) DDoS events\. This metric has a non\-zero value during an event\.Units: Packets  |

### Creating AWS Shield Advanced alarms<a name="shield-alarms"></a>

You can use AWS Shield Advanced metrics for Amazon CloudWatch alarms\. CloudWatch sends notifications or automatically make changes to the resources that you are monitoring based on rules that you define\.

For detailed instructions on creating a CloudWatch alarm, see the [Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html)\. When creating the alarm on the CloudWatch console, to use the Shield Advanced metrics, after choosing **Create an alarm**, choose **AWSDDOSProtectionMetrics** \. You can then create an alarm based on a specific volume of traffic, or you can trigger an alarm whenever a metric is non\-zero\. The second option triggers an alarm for any potential attack that Shield Advanced observes\.

**Note**  
The **AWSDDOSProtectionMetrics** are available only to Shield Advanced customers\.

For more information, see [What is CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

## AWS Firewall Manager notifications<a name="set-fms-alarms"></a>

AWS Firewall Manager doesn't record metrics, so you can't create Amazon CloudWatch alarms specifically for Firewall Manager\. However, you can configure Amazon SNS notifications to alert you to potential attacks\. To create Amazon SNS notifications in Firewall Manager, see [Step 4: Configure Amazon SNS notifications and Amazon CloudWatch alarms](get-started-fms-shield-cloudwatch.md)\.
