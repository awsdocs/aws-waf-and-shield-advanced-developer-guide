# Bot Control components<a name="waf-bot-control-components"></a>

The main components of a Bot Control implementation are the following:
+ **`AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet`** – The Bot Control managed rule group whose rules detect and handle various categories of bots\. For information about the rule group's rules, see [AWS WAF Bot Control rule group](aws-managed-rule-groups-bot.md)\. You include this rule group in your web ACL using a managed rule group reference statement, and indicate the inspection level that you want to use\. This rule group add labels to web requests that it detects as bot traffic\. 
**Note**  
You are charged additional fees when you use this managed rule group\. For more information, see [AWS WAF Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/waf/pricing/)\.
+ **Bot Control dashboard** – The bot monitoring dashboard for your web ACL, available through the web ACL Bot Control tab\. Use this dashboard to monitor your traffic and understand how much of it comes from various types of bots\. This can be a starting point for customizing your bot management, as described in this topic\. You can also use it to verify your changes and monitor activity for various bots and bot categories\. 
+ **JavaScript and mobile application integration SDKs** – You should implement the AWS WAF JavaScript and mobile SDKs if you use the targeted protection level of the Bot Control rule group\. The targeted rules use information provided by the SDKs in the client tokens for enhanced detection against malicious bots\. For more information about the SDKs, see [AWS WAF client application integration](waf-application-integration.md)\.
+ **Logging and metrics** – You can monitor your bot traffic and understand how the Bot Control managed rule group evaluates and handles your traffic by studying the logs and Amazon CloudWatch metrics for your web ACL\. The labels that Bot Control adds to your web requests are included in the logs and in Amazon CloudWatch metrics\. For information about configuring and using logging and metrics, see [Logging web ACL traffic](logging.md) and [Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch](monitoring-cloudwatch.md)\.

  Depending on your needs and the traffic that you see, you might want to customize your Bot Control implementation\. The following are some of the most commonly used options\.
+ **Scope\-down statements** – You can exclude some traffic from the web requests that the Bot Control managed rule group evaluates by adding a scope\-down statement inside the Bot Control managed rule group reference statement\. A scope\-down statement can be any nestable rule statement\. When a request doesn't match the scope\-down statement, AWS WAF evaluates it as not matching the rule group reference statement without evaluating it against the rule group\. For more information about scope\-down statements, see [Scope\-down statements](waf-rule-scope-down-statements.md)\.

  Pricing for the Bot Control managed rule group goes up with the number of web requests that AWS WAF evaluates with it\. You can help reduce these costs by using a scope\-down statement to limit the requests that the rule group evaluates\. For example, you might want to allow your homepage to load for everyone, including bots, and then apply the rule group rules to requests that are going to your application APIs or that contain a particular type of content\. 
+ **Labels and label matching rules** – You can customize how the Bot Control rule group handles some of the bot traffic that it identifies using the AWS WAF label match rule statement\. The Bot Control rule group adds labels to your web requests\. You can add label matching rules after the Bot Control rule group that match on Bot Control labels and apply the handling that you need\. For more information about labeling and using label match statements, see [Label match rule statement](waf-rule-statement-type-label-match.md) and [Labels on web requests](waf-labels.md)\. 
+ **Custom requests and responses** – You can add custom headers to requests that you allow and you can send custom responses for requests that you block by pairing label matching with the AWS WAF custom request and response features\. For more information about customizing requests and responses, see [Customized web requests and responses in AWS WAF](waf-custom-request-response.md)\.
