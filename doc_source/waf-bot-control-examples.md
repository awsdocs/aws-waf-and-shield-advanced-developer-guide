# AWS WAF Bot Control examples<a name="waf-bot-control-examples"></a>

This section shows example configurations that satisfy a variety of common use cases for AWS WAF Bot Control implementations\. 

Each example provides a description of the use case and then shows the solution in JSON listings for the custom configured rules\. 

**Note**  
The JSON listings shown in these examples were created in the console by configuring the rule and then editing it using the **Rule JSON editor**\. You can also retrieve the JSON for the rules in an entire rule group or web ACL using `get` commands through the APIs or the command line interface\.
