# Why you should use the application integration SDKs with Bot Control<a name="waf-bot-with-tokens"></a>

The targeted protections of the Bot Control managed rule group require the challenge tokens that the application integration SDKs generate\. Without the challenge tokens, you can only use the Bot Control common level protections\. For a comparison of the protection levels offered by the rule group, see [AWS WAF Bot Control rule group](aws-managed-rule-groups-bot.md)\. 

We highly recommend implementing the application integration SDKs, for the most effective use of the Bot Control rule group\. The challenge script must run before the Bot Control rule group in order for the rule group to benefit from the tokens that the script acquires\. This happens automatically with the application integration SDKs\. If you are unable to use the SDKs, you can alternately configure your web ACL so that it runs the Challenge or CAPTCHA rule action against all requests that will be inspected by the Bot Control rule group\. Using the Challenge or CAPTCHA rule action can incur additional fees\. For pricing details, see [AWS WAF Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/waf/pricing/)\. 

When you implement the application integration SDKs in your clients or use one of the rule actions that runs the challenge script, you expand the capabilities of the rule group and of your overall client application security\. 

Tokens provide client information with each web request\. This additional information enables the Bot Control rule group to separate legitimate client sessions from ill\-behaved client sessions, even when both originate from a single IP address\. The rule group uses information in the tokens to aggregate client session request behavior for the fine\-tuned detection and mitigation that the targeted protections level provide\.
