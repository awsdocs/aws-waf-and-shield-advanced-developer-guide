# AWS WAF CAPTCHA challenge puzzles<a name="waf-captcha-challenge"></a>

AWS WAF provides standard CAPTCHA functionality that challenges users to confirm that they are human beings\.

AWS WAF randomly generates its CAPTCHA challenge puzzles and rotates through them to ensure that users are presented with unique challenges\. AWS WAF regularly adds new types and styles of puzzles to remain effective against automation techniques\. In addition to the puzzles, the AWS WAF CAPTCHA challenge gathers data about the client to ensure that the task is being completed by a human and to prevent replay attacks\. 

AWS WAF CAPTCHA challenges are designed to be intuitive across multiple geographic regions\. The default puzzles rely on visual elements and various forms of computer interaction\. AWS WAF CAPTCHA includes alternative audio\-based puzzles for users with visual impairment\. The challenges meet the requirements of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG\)\. For information, see [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG\) Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) at the World Wide Web Consortium \(W3C\) website\.

Each CAPTCHA challenge includes a standard set of controls that allow the user to request a new puzzle, switch between audio and visual puzzles, access additional instructions, and submit a puzzle solution\. All puzzles include support for screen readers, keyboard controls, and contrasting colors\. AWS WAF CAPTCHA puzzles are provided in English with fixed messaging and challenge options\. 

A typical visual puzzle requires interaction to complete a specific part of an image, as shown in the following screenshot\.
