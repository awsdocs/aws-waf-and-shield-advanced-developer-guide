AWS rolls out new AWS Managed Rules functionality using three standard deployment stages: release candidate, static version, and default version\. 

The following diagram depicts these standard deployments\. Each is described in more detail in the sections that follow\. 

![\[Four vertical swimlanes show different standard deployment stages. The leftmost swimlane shows the default version set to the recommended static version 1.4. The second swimlane shows the default set to a release candidate (RC) version for testing and tuning. The RC version contains 1.4 rules and RC rules. A note indicates that after testing, the default is returned to the recommended static version. The third swimlane shows the creation of a static version 1.5 from the rules in the release candidate version. The fourth swimlane shows the default version set to the new recommended static version 1.5.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/)
