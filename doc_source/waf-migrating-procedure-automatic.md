# Migrating a web ACL: automated migration<a name="waf-migrating-procedure-automatic"></a>

**To automatically migrate a web ACL configuration from AWS WAF Classic to AWS WAF**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS WAF console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/wafv2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/)\. 

1. Choose **Switch to AWS WAF Classic** and review your configuration settings for the web ACL\. Make note of the settings, considering the caveats and limitations described in the preceding section, [Migration caveats and limitations](waf-migrating-caveats.md)\.

1. In the informational dialogue at the top, locate the sentence that starts with **Migrate web ACLs** and choose the link to the **migration wizard**\. This launches the migration wizard\.

   If you don't see the informational dialogue, you might have closed it since you launched the AWS WAF Classic console\. In the navigation bar, choose **Switch to new AWS WAF** then choose **Switch to AWS WAF Classic**, and the informational dialogue should reappear\.

1. Select the web ACL that you want to migrate\. 

1. For **Migration configuration**, provide an Amazon S3 bucket to use for the template\. You need an Amazon S3 bucket that's configured properly for the migration API, to store the AWS CloudFormation template that it generates\. 
   + The bucket name must start with `aws-waf-migration-`\. For example, `aws-waf-migration-my-web-acl`\.
   + The bucket must be in the Region where you are deploying the template\. For example, for a web ACL in `us-west-2`, you must use an Amazon S3 bucket in `us-west-2` and you must deploy the template stack to `us-west-2`\. 

1. For **S3 bucket policy**, we recommend choosing **Auto apply the bucket policy required for migration**\. Alternatively, if you want to manage the bucket on your own, you must manually apply the following bucket policy: 
   + For global Amazon CloudFront applications \(`waf`\):

     ```
     {
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
             {
                 "Effect": "Allow",
                 "Principal": {
                     "Service": "apiv2migration.waf.amazonaws.com"
                 },
                 "Action": "s3:PutObject",
                 "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET_NAME>/AWSWAF/<CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_ID>/*"
             }
         ]
     }
     ```
   + For regional Amazon API Gateway or Application Load Balancer applications \(`waf-regional`\):

     ```
     {
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
             {
                 "Effect": "Allow",
                 "Principal": {
                     "Service": "apiv2migration.waf-regional.amazonaws.com"
                 },
                 "Action": "s3:PutObject",
                 "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET_NAME>/AWSWAF/<CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_ID>/*"
             }
         ]
     }
     ```

1. For **Choose how to handle rules that cannot be migrated**, choose either to exclude rules that can't be migrated, or to stop the migration\. For information about rules that can't be migrated, see [Migration caveats and limitations](waf-migrating-caveats.md)\. 

1. Choose **Next**\. 

1. For **Create CloudFormation template**, verify your settings, then choose **Start creating CloudFormation template** to begin the migration process\. This can take a few minutes, depending on the complexity of your web ACL\.

1. In **Create and run CloudFormation stack to complete migration**, you can choose to go to the AWS CloudFormation console to create a stack from the template, to create the new web ACL and its resources\. To do this, choose **Create CloudFormation stack**\. 

After the automatic migration process completes, you're ready to proceed to the manual follow\-up steps\. See [Migrating a web ACL: manual follow\-up](waf-migrating-procedure-manual-finish.md)\.
