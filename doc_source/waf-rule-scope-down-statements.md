# Scope\-down statements<a name="waf-rule-scope-down-statements"></a>

You can add a scope\-down statement inside some rules\. The scope\-down statement narrows the scope of the requests that the rule evaluates\. If a rule has a scope\-down statement, traffic is first evaluated using the scope\-down statement\. If it matches that, then it's evaluated using the rule's standard criteria\. Traffic that doesn't match the scope\-down statement results as not matching the rule\. AWS WAF performs no further evaluation\.

You can define a scope\-down statement inside the following statement types: 
+ **Managed rule group statement** – If you add a scope\-down statement to a managed rule group statement, any request that doesn't match the scope\-down statement results as not matching the rule group\. Only those requests that match the scope\-down statement are evaluated against the rule group\. For managed rule groups with pricing that's based on the number of requests evaluated, scope\-down statements can help contain costs\. For more information about managed rule group statements, see [Managed rule group statement](waf-rule-statement-type-managed-rule-group.md)\.
+ **Rate\-based rule statement** – A rate\-based rule without a scope\-down statement controls the rate of all requests that come in to your applications\. If you want to only control the rate for a specific category of requests, you add a scope\-down statement to the rate\-based rule\. For example, to only track and control the rate of requests from a specific geographical area, you specify that geographical ares in a geographic match rule as the scope\-down statement\. For more information about rate\-based rule statements, see [Rate\-based rule statement](waf-rule-statement-type-rate-based.md)\.

You can use any nestable rule in a scope\-down statement\. The WCUs for the scope\-down statement are calculated as the WCUs required for the rule statements that you use in it\. For a list of available statements, see [Rule statements list](waf-rule-statements-list.md)\.
