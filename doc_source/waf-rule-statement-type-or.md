# `OR` rule statement<a name="waf-rule-statement-type-or"></a>

The `OR` rule statement combines nested statements with `OR` logic, so one of the nested statements must match for the `OR` statement to match\. This requires at least one nested statement\. 

For example, if you want to block requests that come from a specific country or that contain a specific query string, you could create an `OR` statement and nest in it a geographic match statement for the country and a string match statement for the query string\. 

If instead you want to block requests that *don't* come from a specific country or that contain a specific query string, you would modify the previous `OR` statement to nest the geographics match statement one level lower, inside a `NOT` statement\. This level of nesting requires you to use the JSON formatting, because the console supports only one level of nesting\.

**Nestable** – You can nest this statement type\. 

**WCUs** – Depends on the nested statements\.

**Where to find this**
