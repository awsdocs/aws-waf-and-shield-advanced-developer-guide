# Working with managed rule groups<a name="waf-using-managed-rule-groups"></a>

This section provides guidance for accessing and managing managed rule groups\. 

**To retrieve a list of managed rule groups**
+ **Console** – During the process of creating a web ACL, on the **Add rules and rule groups** page, choose **Add managed rule groups**\. At the top level, the vendor names are listed\. Expand each vendor listing to see the list of managed rule groups\. When you add a managed rule group to your web ACL, the console lists it based on the naming scheme `<Vendor Name>-<Managed Rule Group Name>`\.
+ **API** – `ListAvailableManagedRuleGroups`
+ **CLI** – `aws wafv2 list-available-managed-rule-groups`

The API and CLI calls return a list of all managed rules that you can reference in the JSON model or through AWS CloudFormation\.

**To retrieve the list of rules in a managed rule group**
+ **Console** 
  + \(Option\) When you add the managed rules group to your web ACL, you can choose **Edit** to view the rules\. 
  + \(Option\) After you've added the managed rule group into your web ACL, from the **Web ACLs** page, choose the web ACL you just created\. This takes you to the web ACL edit page\. 
    + Choose **Rules**\. 
    + Select the rule group you want to see a rules list for, then choose **Edit**\. AWS WAF shows the list of rules in the rule group\. 
+ **API** – `DescribeManagedRuleGroup`
+ **CLI** – `aws wafv2 describe-managed-rule-group --scope REGIONAL --vendor-name <vendor> --name <managedrule_name>`

The API and CLI calls return a list of all rules in the managed rule group that you can reference in the JSON model or through AWS CloudFormation\.

**To add or modify managed rule groups using JSON**  
You can reference and modify managed rule groups within a rule statement using JSON\. The following listing shows the AWS Managed Rules rule group, `AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet`, in JSON format\. The `ExcludedRules` specification lists rules whose actions are overridden to count only\.

```
{
    "Name": "AWS-AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet",
    "Priority": 0,
    "Statement": {
      "ManagedRuleGroupStatement": {
        "VendorName": "AWS",
        "Name": "AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet",
        "ExcludedRules": [
          {
            "Name": "NoUserAgent_HEADER"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    "OverrideAction": {
      "None": {}
    },
    "VisibilityConfig": {
      "SampledRequestsEnabled": true,
      "CloudWatchMetricsEnabled": true,
      "MetricName": "AWS-AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet"
    }
}
```

**To add or modify managed rule groups using AWS CloudFormation**  
You can reference and modify managed rule groups within a rule statement using the AWS CloudFormation template\. The following listing shows the AWS Managed Rules rule group, `AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet`, in AWS CloudFormation template\. The `ExcludedRules` specification lists rules whose actions are overridden to count only\.
