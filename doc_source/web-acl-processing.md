# Web ACL rule and rule group evaluation<a name="web-acl-processing"></a>

The way a web ACL handles a web request depends on the following: 
+ The ordering of the rules and rule groups
+ The action settings on the rules and web ACL
+ Any overrides that you place on the rules and rule groups that you add

For a list of the rule action settings, see [AWS WAF rule action](waf-rule-action.md)\. 

You can customize request and response handling in your rule action settings and default web ACL action settings\. For information, see [Customizing web requests and responses in AWS WAF](waf-custom-request-response.md)\.
